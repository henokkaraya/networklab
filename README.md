# Network Lab (IP Addressing & Routing)

This repository contains a hands-on networking lab built with virtual machines.  
The goal is to practice IP addressing, routing concepts, and connectivity verification in a structured way.

## What I did
- Configured network interfaces and IP addressing
- Verified connectivity between hosts (ping / traceroute)
- Documented routing behavior and troubleshooting steps
- Collected evidence (screenshots + commands/output)

## Evidence

### IP configuration

)

### Routing table
