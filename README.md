# Network Lab (IP Addressing & Routing)

This repository contains a hands-on networking lab built with virtual machines.  
The goal is to practice IP addressing, routing concepts, and connectivity verification in a structured way.

## What I did
- Configured network interfaces and IP addressing
- Verified connectivity between hosts (ping / traceroute)
- Documented routing behavior and troubleshooting steps
- Collected evidence (screenshots + commands/output)

## Evidence

### IP configuration
![IP configuration](screenshots/ip-config.png)

### Routing table
![Routing table](ip-r-after-route)(routerconnect)


### Connectivity test
![Ping test](ping-from-vm1-to-vm3&4)


## Tech & tools
- Virtual machines (VirtualBox / VMware)
- Linux networking basics
- ping, traceroute, ip a, ip r (depending on lab)

## How to navigate this repo
- `/screenshots` – evidence from configuration and connectivity tests (if included)
- `/notes` – lab notes / explanations (if included)
- Other files/folders – depending on the lab structure

## Key learning outcomes
- Understanding of IP/subnetting in practice
- Routing basics and default gateway behavior
- Systematic troubleshooting methodology

## Status
Completed (course lab).
